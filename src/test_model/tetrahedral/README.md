# Tetrahedral Meshes
This folder contains a small collection of tetrahedral meshes. 

Note that HexaLab supports the loading of tetrahedral meshes in a experimental way by an hack: a tetrahedron is considered just a degenerate hexahedron with many collapsed edges. 

WARNING: This is an hack, so many HexaLab features are not available for tetrahedral meshes, all the quality measures are wrong and the separatrix lines are meaningless and should be disabled. Some of the visualization modes works only partially ('rounding' separation mode does not work well, but 'fissure' is reasonable).
